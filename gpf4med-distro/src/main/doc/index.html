<h1>Gpf4Med -- Graph processing framework for medical information</h1>

<p>Gpf4Med is a modular framework for the integration and study of medical information, which is 
distributed under the European Union Public License (EUPL v.1.1). Currently, a module is available 
that allows the study of clinical reports on breast cancer. The framework supports DICOM-SR to 
facilitate interoperability among studies collected at different centres using clinical examination, 
medical imaging (mammography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging -- MRI) and biopsy.</p>

<p>The data is combined in a graph and the different medical terminologies and ontologies annotations 
are used to interconnect the objects represented in the graph (e.g. patient, lesion, exploration). Other 
types of information may be integrated in the future when other information becomes available, such 
as genetic, histopathological, biomolecular and pharmacological data.</p>

<p>A RESTful service is provided that allows users to query the graph. The framework can leverage on
Cloud computing resources to address the study of large datasets. Indeed, the framework aims at 
supporting studies that cannot be addressed solely using the traditional storage and computing systems
of the hospital.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Gpf4Med is provided as a single JAR file that contains all software dependencies within. This JAR is 
intended to be deployed with a POSIX-based server and consists of a HTTP server and a graph database.</p>

<p>To install the <em>DICOM graph study service</em>, create the directory <em>/opt/gpf4med/</em> and 
extract the latest version of the framework. For example:</p>

<code>$ mkdir /opt/gpf4med/ ; cd /opt/gpf4med/ ; tar xvzf gpf4med-distro-1.0.0.tar.gz</code>

<p>After the framework is installed, you can execute the JAR with Java to run the service with the 
default configuration parameters:</p>

<code>$ java -jar lib/java/gpf4med.jar</code>

<p>This will start the <em>DICOM graph study service</em> with WADL available in:</p>

<code>http://&lt;hostname&gt;:8080/gpf4med/application.wadl</code>

<p>Optionally, you can pass the option <em>--daemon|-d</em> to the service to start the service in 
daemon mode (detached from the console):</p>

<code>$ java -jar lib/java/gpf4med.jar -d</code>

<p>You may deploy as many instances of the <em>DICOM graph study service</em> as you need to address 
large-scale studies. In order to do so, you should deploy an instance of the <em>DICOM graph manager 
service</em> to configure and use the <em>DICOM graph study service</em> instances in your study.</p>

<p>Next sections provide further details about configuration options.</p>

<h2>Service configuration</h2>

<p>You should have the following structure of directories, after you installed the <em>DICOM graph 
study service</em> in your local file-system:</p>

<code>
/opt/gpf4med<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|-&gt; bin/<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`-&gt; gpf4med<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|-&gt; etc/<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|-&gt; gpf4med.xml<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|-&gt; gpf4med-container.xml<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`-&gt; logback.xml<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|-&gt; htdocs/<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`-&gt; *<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|-&gt; lib/<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`-&gt; java/<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`-&gt; gpf4med.jar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`-&gt; LICENSE
</code>

<p>The directory <em>etc/</em> contains the base configuration file of the service and the service 
container. You can edit the file <em>gpf4med.xml</em> to set the location of the graph plugins and the 
report templates. Also, you can edit the file <em>gpf4med-container.xml</em> to set the host name or IP 
address where the service will be binded. Similarly, you can set in this file the network port where the 
service listens for incoming connections.</p>

<p>To specify different configuration files you can pass the option <em>--configuration|-c</em> to the
service:</p>

<code>$ java -jar lib/java/gpf4med.jar -c /opt/gpf4med/etc/</code>

<p>The file <em>logback.xml</em> contains the configuration of the logging system. This file uses the  
<a href="http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html#syntax"> logback configuration file syntax</a>.
</p>

<p>To specify a different logging configuration you can pass the option <em>-Dlogback.configurationFile</em>
to the Java Virtual Machine:</p>

<code>$ java -Dlogback.configurationFile=/opt/gpf4med/etc/logback.xml -jar lib/java/gpf4med.jar</code>

<p>The <em>gpf4med</em> script in the directory <em>bin/</em> provides a simple manner to start and stop 
the service in daemon mode, reading the default configurations from the directory: 
<em>/opt/gpf4med/etc/</em>.</p>

<p>You can add this script to the path of the default user by creating a link in <em>/usr/local/bin/</em>:
</p>

<code>$ sudo ln -s /opt/gpf4med/bin/gpf4med /usr/local/bin/gpf4med</code>

<p>You can start/stop the service with <em>gpf4med</em> following manner:</p>

<code>$ gpf4med start</code>

<br>

<code>$ gpf4med stop</code>

<p>By default, a service started in this manner will write its logging messages to the directory: 
<em>/opt/gpf4med/var/log/</em>. The main log file is: <em>gpf4med.log</em>.</p>

<h3>System architecture</h3>

<p>Gpf4Med consists of a graph store and a search engine that are provided in the <em>DICOM graph study 
service</em>. This service uses the <em>Document fetcher</em> to download the clinical reports from the
<em>DICOM store</em> where the information is stored and caches a copy in the local file-system of the
server. The <em>Document fetcher</em> can optionally encrypt the cached copy with strong cryptography.</p>

<p>The <em>Graph driver</em> is used to load the reports to the graph. The graph can be accessed directly
through the RESTful interface of the <em>DICOM graph study service</em>, or in the case of large studies,
through the <em>DICOM graph manager service</em>. The <em>DICOM graph manager service</em> uses the 
<em>Infrastructure manager</em> to allocate computing and storage resources in a Cloud infrastructure to
execute the instances of the <em>DICOM graph study service</em> needed for a specific study. Graph 
operations that are executed in the <em>DICOM graph manager service</em>, such as searching the graph, 
will be executed over the complete graph distributed among the instances of the <em>DICOM graph study 
service</em>.</p>

<h3>Graph plugins</h3>

<p>The framework can be extended with new graphs and operations by adding new plugins to the <em>DICOM 
graph study service</em>. The list of available plugins are read from a text file (one link per line) and 
loaded in the service during startup. The plugins can be configured in the <em>gpf4med.xml</em> file.</p>

<p>The plugins can be loaded from the <code>htdocs/</code> directory of the <em>DICOM graph study 
service</em>. For example, to load the plugins from <code>htdocs/connectors</code>, configure your 
service to load connectors from:</p>

<code>http://localhost/connectors</code>

<p>or</p>

<code>file:///opt/gpf4med/htdocs/connectors</code>

<h3>Report templates</h3>

<p>In a similar manner as new plugins are loaded during service startup, new templates can be loaded too.
The list of available templates are read from a text file (one link per line) and can be configured in 
the <em>gpf4med.xml</em> file.</p>

<p>The templates can be loaded from the <code>htdocs/</code> directory of the <em>DICOM graph study 
service</em>. For example, to load the templates from <code>htdocs/templates</code>, configure your 
service to load templates from:</p>

<code>http://localhost/templates</code>

<p>or</p>

<code>file:///opt/gpf4med/htdocs/templates</code>

<h3>Advanced configuration</h3>

<p>Gpf4Med can be configured to allocate computing and storage resources from an infrastructure manager.
The current version of the framework uses Apache jclouds to provide the <em>DICOM graph manager 
service</em> with access to a variety of Cloud infrastructure provider. This configuration has been 
tested with Amazon EC2 and OpenNebula.</p>

<h4>Large-scale deployments</h4>

<h2>Security</h2>

<h3>Configure the access to the DICOM stores</h3>

<p>The container has a list of authorized DICOM stores and connector providers.</p>

<p><em>To be completed...</em></p>

<h3>Secure local cache</h3>

<p>Two configuration parameters are available that allows to encrypt the local storage &amp; cache and to 
use strong cryptography when available.</p>

<h2>Quick build</h2>

<p>Gpf4Med is organized as a Maven project with a bill of materials (BOM) pattern. To build the project,
download the latest source code and enter the base directory of the project:</p>

<code>$ cd &lt;WORKSPACE&gt;/gpf4med/</code>

<p>Install the Gpf4Med and the main project POM into your local Maven repository by executing the 
following Maven command:</p>

<code>$ mvn install:install-file -Dfile=pom.xml -DpomFile=pom.xml</code>

<br><br>

<code>$ mvn clean install -pl gpf4med-project</code>

<p>During the installation of the base BOM and POM, several additional Maven packages and dependencies 
will be installed in your repository. This step will no longer needed until you upgrade the major version 
of Gpf4Med (for example from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0).</p>

<p>After the installation is completed, change to the directory of the base project directory and then
compile and install the framework to your local Maven repository:</p>

<code>$ cd &lt;WORKSPACE&gt;/gpf4med/gpf4med-project/</code>

<br><br>

<code>$ mvn clean install -pl gpf4med-core,gpf4med-data,gpf4med-service</code>

<p>As with any other Maven-based project, you can skip unit tests by passing the 
<em>-Dmaven.test.skip=true</em> parameter to Maven:</p>

<code>$ mvn clean install -pl gpf4med-core,gpf4med-data,gpf4med-service -Dmaven.test.skip=true</code>

<p>Optionally, you can create a distribution package to facilitate installation:</p>

<code>$ mvn clean package -pl gpf4med-distro</code>

<p>Finally, you may build the graph plugins and make them available to the <em>DICOM graph study 
service</em>, for example by serving the plugin JAR file with a HTTP server:</p>

<code>$ mvn clean package -pl gpf4med-graph-base</code>

<br><br>

<code>$ scp gpf4med-graph-base/target/gpf4med-graph-base-&lt;VERSION&gt;.jar 
&lt;hostname&gt;:/var/www/gpf4med/connectors/&lt;VERSION&gt;/</code>

<p>You must update your configuration to include the new plugin. For example, if in your 
<em>gpf4med.xml</em> the graph plugins are loaded from:</p>

<code>http://&lt;hostname&gt;/gpf4med/connectors/&lt;VERSION&gt;/index.txt</code>

<p>Then, you must add a new line to this file in the following manner:</p>

<code>http://&lt;hostname&gt;/gpf4med/connectors/&lt;VERSION&gt;/gpf4med-graph-base-&lt;VERSION&gt;.jar</code>

<p>Also, you must make available the DICOM-SR templates to the <em>DICOM graph study service</em>. For 
example, you can copy the default templates in the following manner:</p>

<code>$ scp gpf4med-core/src/test/resources/files/templates/* 
&lt;hostname&gt;:/var/www/gpf4med/templates/&lt;VERSION&gt;/</code>

<p>Similarly to the graph plugins, update your configuration to include the new templates. For this
purpose, update the file from where the templates are loaded. For example:</p>

<code>http://&lt;hostname&gt;/gpf4med/templates/&lt;VERSION&gt;/index.txt</code>

<p>Adding the following lines:</p>

<code>http://&lt;hostname&gt;/gpf4med/templates/&lt;VERSION&gt;/01_Exploration_of_Breast.xml</code>
<br>
<code>http://&lt;hostname&gt;/gpf4med/templates/&lt;VERSION&gt;/02_Mamography.xml</code>
<br>
<code>http://&lt;hostname&gt;/gpf4med/templates/&lt;VERSION&gt;/03_UltrasoundScan.xml</code>
<br>
<code>http://&lt;hostname&gt;/gpf4med/templates/&lt;VERSION&gt;/04_RM.xml</code>
<br>
<code>http://&lt;hostname&gt;/gpf4med/templates/&lt;VERSION&gt;/05_BiopsiaPre.xml</code>
<br>
<code>http://&lt;hostname&gt;/gpf4med/templates/&lt;VERSION&gt;/06_BiopsiaPost.xml</code>
<br>

<p>Start the <em>DICOM graph study service</em> and check that the graph plugins and the report templates
are successfully loaded:</p>

<code>http://&lt;hostname&gt;:8080/gpf4med/graphrs/list/graphs</code>

<br><br>

<code>http://&lt;hostname&gt;:8080/gpf4med/graphrs/list/templates</code>

<h2>Extending the framework</h2>

<p>The framework needs at minimum Java 7. If you have more that one version of Java installed at your
workspace, you may need to add Java 7 to your path. For example, you can do so with the following:</p>

<code>$ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/sw/java/jdk1.7.0_45 ; export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH ; java -version</code>

<p>The Maven module <em>gpf4med-service</em> contains the code of the <em>DICOM graph study service</em>.
This module was created from the Maven archetype for JAX-RS services with Jervey and Grizzly:</p>

<code>$ mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.glassfish.jersey.archetypes
-DarchetypeArtifactId=jersey-quickstart-grizzly2 -DarchetypeVersion=2.5.1</code>

<p>You can check how your changes affects the framework, after you introduced a new update in the code of 
the <em>DICOM graph study service</em> by executing Maven with the following parameters:</p>

<code>$ mvn clean compile exec:java -pl gpf4med-service</code>

<p>The Maven module <em>gpf4med-enactor</em> contains the code of the <em>DICOM graph manager service</em>.
This module was created from the Maven archetype for Jersey-based web application projects:</p>

<code>$ mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.glassfish.jersey.archetypes 
-DarchetypeArtifactId=jersey-quickstart-webapp -DarchetypeVersion=2.5.1</code>

</ul>

<h3>Creating new graph connectors</h3>

<p>To create a new graph plugin (connectors), implements the interface 
<em>org.grycap.gpf4med.ext.GraphConnector</em> and annotate your class with the information about
authorship and version of your plugin. For example:</p>

<code>
package my_package;<br>
<br>
@Author(name = "MY INSTITUTION")<br>
@Version(version = 10000)<br>
@PluginImplementation<br>
public class MyConnector implements GraphConnector {<br>	
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@Override<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public String path() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "my-graph";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>
}</code>

<p>You can use the Maven module <em>gpf4med-graph-base</em> as a reference for the development of new 
graph connectors.</p>

<h3>Testing the framework</h3>

<p>The framework uses the new assertion mechanism based on Hamcrest, which is available as of JUnit 4.4.
